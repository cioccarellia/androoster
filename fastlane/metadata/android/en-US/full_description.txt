<i>Androoster</i> is a comprehensive open-source and free Android root tweak toolbox. It is built to help you tweak your device, keeping it cool, fast and responsive.

Ideally, basing on your device hardware and your personal needs, you can find a set of parameters for Androoster to improve things you value and minimize others you don't require.

Being a collection of on-off tweaks, you can enable/disable whichever set of parameters you desire. Although a certain degree of expertise is required to tune (or eyeball) settings, you can refine your tweaks according to the performance changes you experience incrementally.

The key takeaway is that there is no such thing as a universal tweak / booster. Instead, you can (and should) tune settings according to the things you value the most to maximize performance in those designated areas, and keep the unavoidable consequences within an acceptable margin of degradation

(i.e, a strong performance improvement degrades battery duration, and vice versa, differently for every device and OS).
